    "\n",
    "In this project, we position ourselves as a part of the Data Scientist Team in a Financial Institution, MPL Bank, in Washington DC, USA. We are assigned to work on a project to develop a Machine Learning (ML) solution. The project owner is the Underwriter Team$^1$ of MPL Bank. We will help the Underwriter Team to make an improvement in their process of underwriting, specifically in the process of property appraisal$^2$ and valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPL Bank orders the appraisal through a third party, an appraisal management company (AMC)$^3$, in order to comply with the federal appraiser independence requirements$^4$. However, the appraisal process performed by an external party has a risk of fraud$^5$ or producing erroneous results$^6$. Thus, the project owner wants to address these issues."

    "# I. Problem Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the elicitation process with the project owner, we found that they want to improve the accuracy of their underwriting process, specifically in the process of evaluating the appraisal. In the process of evaluating appraisals, there are some risks that the project owner wants to minimize, such as fraud and erroneous appraisal results given by the AMC. In addition, there is also a problem that often happens regarding the difference between the agreed offer made by a borrower and the property seller and the actual property valuation. Since lenders can’t lend out money more than a property is worth$^7$, all of these risks may cause the project owner to determine wrong appraisal value and to make a wrong decision whether to give the loan to a borrower$^8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these risks and improve their business process, the project owner needs a reliable autonomous system that can provide an estimation value that can be used to compare the value given by the AMC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output of this project is a system that can make an estimation of an accurate and reasonable value (price) for a property based on the aspects of the property by using ML. However, due to the limitation of our time budget, we limit the capability of our model in this project to predict an output only for properties with grade lower than Exceptional, since Exceptional properties have a price range that is very different than the rest of properties with other grades."

    "- To maximize profit by making the right decision to give a loan with an optimal amount.\n",
    "- To minimize loss and risks of fraud and erroneous valuation$^9$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The value that we want to predict is the value (price) of a property. The required information to make a prediction are the features of the property (e.g., gross building area, the number of rooms, the number of bedrooms, etc), the condition of the property, the location, etc."

    "## 4. Analytic Approach\n",
    "### Machine Learning Techniques\n",
    "Since the value (price) that we want to predict is a continuous value, this problem can be addressed with Supervised Learning, more specifically Regression, and the approach to generalization is a model-based learning. We will feed the data in the training set to Regression algorithms which then will tune some parameters to fit the model, and then hopefully it will be able to make good predictions on future/unknown instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk\n",
    "There are two possible risks that may be caused by wrong prediction from the ML model:\n",
    "- The first scenario is when the actual value of the property is higher than the prediction value (the model gives under appraised$^1$$^0$ value), this could cause MPL Bank to reject giving loan and thus resulting in loss of potential borrower.\n",
    "- The second scenario is when the actual value of the property is lower than prediction value, this could cause MPL Bank to suffer loss when the borrower is unable to pay back the loan.\n",

    "The performance measures to evaluate the ML model are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Median Absolute Error and the Coefficient of Determination (R$^2$). \n"

Thus, we hope this project could also protect <b>property owners</b> by providing fair and reliable property valuation prediction.\n"
